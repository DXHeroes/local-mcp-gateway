## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this open source?

No. This is **source-available**, not open source. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) requires licenses to permit commercial use, which this does not.

### Can I fork this project?

You can fork and modify for non-commercial use. You cannot offer your fork commercially without a license.

### What about community contributions?

Contributions are welcome under the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Contributors retain copyright but grant us the right to use contributions under both licenses.

### How does evaluation work?

You can evaluate commercially for 30 days. After that, you need a Commercial License to continue business use.
